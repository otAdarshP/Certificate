# VaLiDiFy-Certificate valdidation using Blockchain & AI
 This project focuses on tackling the increasing issue of credential fraud using Blockchain Technology combined with Al and advanced Machine Learning algorithms. With 34% of resumes, 5% of academic certificates, and 23% of job applications in South Asian countries containing anomalies, the need for a secure and transparent certificate verification system has never been greater.  Our solution leverages Al to detect tampering attempts, analyze data patterns, and verify consistency, ensuring robust security through cryptographic methods and MongoDB-backed database management. This integration provides a scalable and adaptable approach to secure digital certificate validation, setting it apart from existingÂ research.
